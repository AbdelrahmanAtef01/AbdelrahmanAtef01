I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student 💻 with a focus on Embedded Systems 📟, Data Science 📊, and Computer Vision 🎞. I'm driven by a passion to create complete solutions, starting from hardware and playing with visual inputs to extracting insights from complex data and making informed decisions. My approach integrates all three to build systems starting from hardware and low level programming up until extracting complex information and transfer it into powerful data-driven insights.

## 🌟 About Me
- 🎓 **Specialization**: Embedded Systems, Data Science, Computer Vision
- 🎯 **Focus**: Building hardware solutions, transforming data into actionable insights and using visual inputs for data extraction and insights.
- 🤩 **Passion**: Integrating hardware, data processing, and decision-making into cohesive systems.
