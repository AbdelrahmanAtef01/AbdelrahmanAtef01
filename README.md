## Currently Learning
Iâ€™m actively strengthening skills that directly support production-grade, real-time systems and full-stack productization:
- **Django** â€” building web backends and admin tools for ML/analytics products.  
- **Docker** & **containerization** â€” production deployments, reproducible pipelines and CI-friendly images.  
- **ROS** â€” integrating perception and control for robotics and embedded platforms.  
- **Linux systems** â€” server/edge device ops, tuning for low-latency workloads.  
- Continued deepening of **Azure** and **AWS** for scalable inference and data pipelines.

## What I Deliver
- **End-to-end intelligent systems** â€” from embedded hardware and sensor integration to cloud-deployed, real-time AI pipelines.  
- **High-performance AI & computer vision solutions** â€” optimized for accuracy, low latency and scalability.  
- **Advanced sports tech pipelines** â€” multi-camera tracking, event detection and data-driven performance insights.

## Collaboration
If youâ€™re building computer vision pipelines,sports analytics, robotics or need help taking CV/ML from prototype to production, letâ€™s talk.
